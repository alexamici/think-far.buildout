Most stuff refers to the currently logged user:

    >>> from google.appengine.api.users import User
    >>> current_user = User(email=u'sid@pf.com')

First we can describe assets and asset groups

    >>> from thinkfar.gae.model import Asset
    >>> from datetime import date

I've got a bike.

    >>> bike = Asset(name=u'good looking bike', owner=current_user, purcase_date=date(1967, 3, 23))
    >>> bike.purcase_price = 100.
    >>> bike
    <Asset object name="good looking bike" owner="sid@pf.com">
    >>> bike_key = bike.put()

I've got a cloak.

    >>> cloak = Asset(name=u'red and black cloak', owner=current_user, purcase_date=date(1967, 3, 23),
    ...     purcese_price=20)
    >>> cloak_key = cloak.put()
