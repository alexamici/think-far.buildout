Most stuff refers to the currently logged user:

    >>> from google.appengine.api.users import User
    >>> current_user = User(email=u'sid@pf.com')

First we can describe assets and asset groups

    >>> from thinkfar.gae.model import Asset
    >>> from datetime import date

I've got a bike

    >>> bike = Asset(name=u'bike', owner=current_user, purcase_date=date(1967, 3, 23))
    >>> bike
    <Asset object name="bike" owner="sid@pf.com">
    >>> bike_key = bike.put()
